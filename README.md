 
Introduction
Pet Rescue Charity, an unwavering advocate for animal welfare, orchestrates an annual donation drive that serves as the heartbeat of its operations. This endeavor spans the diverse neighborhoods of Toronto, Brampton, Mississauga, Oakville, and Grimsby, reflecting a commitment to reach every corner of the community. In these locales, a dedicated cadre of volunteers takes on the mission of going door-to-door, not merely collecting funds but fostering a sense of community engagement in the name of a shared cause.
The charity's annual donation drive is not just a financial cornerstone; it symbolizes a collective effort to safeguard and nurture the well-being of animals. As these volunteers traverse the city, they become the conduits through which the community expresses its support for the cause, encapsulating the ethos of compassion and responsibility towards our furry companions. The success of this initiative is intricately tied to the generosity of the residents, whose contributions, whether in cash, checks, or credit card payments, fuel the charity's multifaceted operations.
Amidst this endeavor lies a meticulous process of data collection, a trove of information encapsulated in the Database.csv. This data, as varied as the residents contributing to it, includes not only the financial particulars but also the geographical nuances and the individuals—both volunteers and donors—who play pivotal roles in the realization of the charity's mission. This report delves into the transformative journey of this data, from the grassroots efforts of volunteers to the establishment of a robust database, employing dimensional modeling to extract meaningful insights and facilitate informed decision-making.
Database Structure - Central Donations Repository
Database implementation involves the process of designing, creating, and managing a database system. It requires setting up the necessary infrastructure, such as creating the database itself and importing data into it. In this context, a database named "BI" was created to serve as the Central Donations Repository. A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. 
The "BI" database is specifically designed to store and manage information related to donations. The process of bringing data from an external source into a database is called data import. In this case, the provided "Database.csv" file was used to import data into the "BI" database. BULK INSERT is a command or feature in a database management system that allows for efficient and accurate transfer of large amounts of data from an external file into a database. It is used to streamline the import process and ensure that the data is inserted correctly into the designated tables in the database.
Address:
•	Columns: unit_num, street_number, street_name, street_type, street_direction, postal_code, city, province
Volunteer:
•	Columns: first_name, last_name, group_leader
Donation:
•	Columns: donor_first_name, donor_last_name, donation_date, donation_amount, payment_method
Dimensional Modeling
Dimensional modeling is a data modeling technique used to organize data in a way that is optimized for querying and analysis. It involves identifying the key business dimensions and fact tables that are relevant to the organization's data.
Identification of Dimensions:
Dimensions are the descriptive attributes or characteristics by which a business measures its performance. In this case, the identified dimensions include date, location (city, postal code), and payment method. These dimensions will be used to slice and dice the data to gain insights into donation patterns.
Fact Table
The Central_Donations_Repository serves as the nucleus of the schema, encapsulating details about donor names, donation dates, amounts, and payment methods. It transforms raw data into a structured format, laying the foundation for streamlined analysis.
Dimension Tables
Date Dimension:
Purpose: Beyond being a temporal anchor, the Date_Dimension allows for nuanced analysis of donation trends. Fields such as day, month, and year enable the charity to explore temporal patterns, identifying peak donation periods or assessing the impact of specific events on contribution levels.
Location Dimension:
Purpose: Geographical context is paramount. The Location_Dimension, with fields like postal code, city, and province, adds a spatial layer to the analysis. This enables the charity to discern regional variations, identify areas of high or low donation activity, and tailor outreach efforts accordingly.
Payment Method Dimension:
Purpose:
The PaymentMethod_Dimension in the dimensional model provides a categorical perspective on the donation data. By categorizing donations based on payment methods, the charity can assess the popularity and effectiveness of different payment mechanisms. This information helps in optimizing transaction processes and making informed decisions.
Relationships between the fact table and each dimension table serve as celestial connections. These connections seamlessly integrate temporal, spatial, and categorical dimensions. Similar to the harmony of a star system, this optimized structure simplifies querying and analyzing donation data, empowering the charity with actionable insights.
The adoption of the dimensional modeling approach in the star schema is not just a structural choice but a strategic one. It transforms the data from a static repository into a dynamic analytical tool. This enables the charity to extract nuanced insights and navigate its operations with agility and precision.
This transformative journey, from grassroots efforts to dimensional modeling, reflects a commitment to leveraging data as a catalyst for informed, strategic action rather than mere information.
Stored Procedures
In the realm of data analysis, stored procedures play a pivotal role. Three dynamic and flexible stored procedures have been crafted to provide invaluable insights into donation patterns, supporting informed decision-making and strategic planning.
GetDonationStatsByDate:
Purpose: Calculate the average and sum of donations based on the donation date.
Logic: Selects day, month, and year from the donation_date, then uses AVG and SUM aggregate functions to compute the average (avg_amount) and total sum (total_amount) of donations for each unique combination of day, month, and year.
 
GetDonationStatsByLocationAndMonth:
Purpose: Calculate the average and sum of donations based on postal code and city within a specific month.
Logic: Takes two input parameters, @target_city and @target_month. Filters data based on the provided city and month, then uses AVG and SUM aggregate functions to compute the average (avg_amount) and total sum (total_amount) of donations for each unique combination of postal code and city in the specified month.
 
GetAmountByPaymentMethod:
Purpose: Determine the amount collected per payment method from the city with the highest total value of donations.
Logic: Introduces flexibility with @payment_method variable. Identifies the city with the maximum total donation value, filters data to include only donations from that city, and uses the SUM aggregate function to calculate the total amount collected for the specified payment method.
 
Conclusion
In conclusion, the implementation of a robust database system and associated stored procedures is transformative for the effective management and analysis of donation-related data within the pet rescue charity context. The creation of the "BI" database, structured with a comprehensive star schema, ensures an optimized foundation for data analysis. The central fact table, Central_Donations_Repository, encapsulates key donation information, while dimension tables such as Date_Dimension, Location_Dimension, and PaymentMethod_Dimension provide temporal, spatial, and categorical context, respectively.
The meticulous process of data population, facilitated by the BULK INSERT command, ensures that the charity's central repository is populated with accurate and meaningful data, laying the groundwork for informed decision-making.
The significance of the stored procedures, such as GetDonationStatsByDate, GetDonationStatsByLocationAndMonth, and GetAmountByPaymentMethod, cannot be overstated. These procedures are crafted with flexibility in mind, utilizing variables to enable dynamic analyses based on temporal, geographical, and payment-related parameters. The logic within these procedures allows for the calculation of essential donation metrics, empowering the charity to gain actionable insights into donation patterns.
In conclusion, the comprehensive approach from database creation to stored procedure development empowers the pet rescue charity to make informed decisions, plan strategically, and continue its mission of animal welfare through successful donation management. This holistic system not only ensures the efficient handling of current donations but also equips the charity with the tools to plan for a sustainable future.
